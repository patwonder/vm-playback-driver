    we're seeing issues building and using the versions of vgabios and

qemu-kvm (0.12.3-0ubuntu2) lucid; urgency=low

  * New patch, arm-host-fix-compiler-warning, drops __arm__ specific code
    which was probably FPA specific (certainly not ARM/VFP) and was dropped
    upstream in bc4347b883e8175dadef77ed9e02ccaa5e8eba94; helps build on
    armel.
  * Configure builds with --disable-strip to get useful -dbgsym packages.
  * Also configure the static build with --disable-blobs and
    --audio-drv-list=.
  * Configure builds with --interp-prefix=/etc/qemu-binfmt/%M as to allow
    overriding shared libs etc. with files over there; this matches Debian's
    config.
  * Match Debian's audio-drv-list to only build ALSA on linux.
  * Also filter-out config-host.mak when copying files to the static build dir
    to avoid a race if the build is interrupted before the static configure
    has run.
  * After careful examination, drop TARGET_SYSTEM_TCG and TARGET_LINUX_TCG;
    the upstream configure turns all these on by default plus one recently
    added architecture (microblaze) which proves that this list can't be kept
    up-to-date.  Also drop ia64 specific settings -- the ia64 build doesn't
    pass in Ubuntu ATM anyway, and Debian doesn't special ia64, so it can only
    help, right?  Do however pass --target-list="" for now as the current
    upstream configure sets x86_64-softmmu as the default.
  * Also drop TARGET_STATIC_TCG and pass --disable-system; this will turn off
    all softmmu targets and do the right thing; while this will increase the
    size of the binary package, this will also permit development towards
    other targets such as powerpc, or running x86 binaries from ARM.  Also
    pass --target-list="".
  * Drop unused QEMU_EXE and BUILD_CPU vars.
  * Add more binfmts, copied from the Debian qemu package but modified to
    point at the qemu-kvm-extras-static package instead of qemu-user-static
    and to set "credentials yes"; also dropped spurious trailing newlines on
    some of them.  Copy the logic to set BINFMT_TARGETS from the Debian
    package as well.
  * Create qemu-kvm-extras dirs via debian/*.dirs instead of mkdir.
  * Depend on $(QUILT_STAMPFN) instead of patch to avoid rebuilding everything
    every time.

  * New patch, Don-t-bark-for-syscalls-missing-in-linux-too, implements stubs
    for pselect6(), ppoll(), and epoll_wait() on ARM to avoid the console

  * Add debian/TODO list.

  * New patch, 60_armv4l-typo, from upstream
    a302c32ded4d458fead907a98d079e8fb15f7b08; fixes a typo in configure (arm4l
    instead of armv4l) which breaks the build on armel.

qemu-kvm (0.11.0~rc2-0ubuntu9) karmic; urgency=low

  * Use bamboo.dtb instead of bamboo.dtd in powerpc rules; this seems to be
    the correct filename and AFAICT there's no support for generating any .dtd
    file in the upstream rules but only support for .dtb files; should help
    the powerpc build somewhat.
  * Disable qemu-kvm build on armel since there is no kernel support for it
    for now; should help the armel build somewhat.
    - Use dh_listpackages to check whether we want the qemu-kvm package and
      set DO_KVM accordingly.
    - Only $(MAKE) install in kvm/libkvm if DO_KVM is enabled.
  * On ia64 set TARGET_SYSTEM_TCG = ia64-softmmu and empty TARGET_LINUX_TCG
    since ia64 doesn't support CPU emulation mode (syscall wrapping) nor code
    generation for ia64, so can only run ia64 code on ia64 in system emulation
    mode; should help the ia64 build somewhat.

qemu-kvm (0.11.0~rc2-0ubuntu8) karmic; urgency=low

  * Drop awful binary-static target; binary-arch works fine and binary-static
    is not guaranteed to be called (in fact it was only called on the arch:
    all buildd, i.e. i386, even if there are no arch: all packages here).
    Similarly, merge build-static commands with build-arch commands.
    Similarly, merge install-static commands with install commands.
  * Replace configure-static with $(STATIC_BUILDDIR)/config.status which
    matches config.status; let $(STATIC_BUILDDIR)/config.status depend on
    configure.
  * Depending on whether we want to build a qemu-%-static package, as reported
    by dh_listpackages, set DO_STATIC and MAYBE_STATIC_CONFIG to "yes" and
    $(STATIC_BUILDDIR)/config.status (or "no" and empty) and use these vars to
    conditionalize the build.
  * Drop unexisting targets from .PHONY.
  * Let build depend on build-indep and build-arch.
  * Use $(MAKE) -C instead of cd && $(MAKE).
  * Consistenly use $() for make vars instead of mixing with ${}.
  * Drop conditional for quilt.make being present, it's always satisfied per
    build-deps, and move the include to the top of rules.
  * Remove boilerplate comments from rules.
  * Don't overwrite CFLAGS from the environment and honour DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
    in a more condensed manner.
  * Use DEB_BUILD_ARCH instead of calling dpkg-architecture repeatedly.
  * Let the config.status targets depend on patch instead of configure.
  * Rename STATIC_BUILDDIR to debian/build-static to avoid clashes with a
    possible qemu-static.
  * No need for build-{arch,indep} to depend on patch, actually they should
    only depend on the -stamp file which itself should depend on
    config.status targets.
  * Drop build-arch/build-indep split in favour of a single build target; the
    split was unused and not supported properly anyway; let install depend on
    build and binary-{indep,arch} depend on install.
  * Also pass -k debian/changelog.qemu debian/changelog.kvm to
    dh_installchangelogs in binary-arch.
  * Drop unused binary-indep commands.
  * Drop -s from dh_testdir/dh_testroot.
  * Test for config-host.mak before calling $(MAKE) in clean: and drop the
    bogus dep on the config.status target.
  * Call unpatch explicitly after distclean instead of using a dep as we don't
    want to run upstream rules unpatched.
  * Rename config.status targets to config-host.mak since it's the actual name
    of the file spit by configure.
  * Rework copying of sources for static build to filter-out the debian and
    potentially the static build dir and hence avoid the || true error
    handler.
  * Install old Debian changelogs debian/changelog.{kvm,qemu} with
    dh_installdocs; drop the dh_installchangelogs hacks, that resurrects the
    actual upstream changelog.
  * Drop bogus debian/qemu-arm-static.install for now as it installs to the
    wrong dir.
  * Rework qemu-arm-static.{postint,prerm} to not hardcode the update-binfmts
    pathname, not do useless tests, and to drop boilerplate.
  * Rework postinst to set -e and to drop boilerplate.
  * Add install-stamp to run install only once; install should really be
    reworked to install to debian/tmp, moving the copying to binary packages
    to binary-%.
  * Add watch file.
  * Add debian/README.source pointing at the quilt one.

qemu-kvm (0.11.0~rc1-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Initial packaging of qemu-kvm ]
  * This package is a complex merger of the traditional Debian and Ubuntu
    qemu and kvm packages.  Upstream is in the process of integrating all
    kvm-specific code into the qemu project, which is being delivered as a
    new package called qemu-kvm.  This should provide all of the userspace
    required to use kvm.  The kvm project, instead, is going to focus on the
    kvm kernel module.  The qemu-kvm project will deliver a stable, maintained
    userspace.  This qemu-kvm package replaces both qemu and kvm in Ubuntu.
  * debian/changelog.kvm, debian/changelog.qemu: keep these two files around,
    as these provide tremendous history and logging about the packaging
  * debian/control, debian/10-kvm.fdi, debian/install,
    debian/org.freedesktop.hal.kvm.policy: drop hal as it's being deprecated
  * debian/reportbug-hook.sh: dropped; use 'ubuntu-bug qemu-kvm' now
  * debian/control:
    - lower the debhelper dependency, should make backports
    easier, newer builds will use the newer debhelper for udev stuff, older
    versions just won't
    - drop autotools-dev build dependency, no longer needed
    - add armel to build architecture
    - description updated
    - drop the qemu package (for now)
    - drop the Pre-depends on adduser
  * debian/rules:
    - drop double call of dh_installdeb
    - install each of the changelogs
    - drop zcat of network bins; these have been no-ops for us for a long
      time, kept around to minimize diff with Debian
    - move common i386 and x86_64 code to common location
    - drop pxe rom's, as these are provided by kvm-pxe
    - establish some links to help with the merger of kvm/qemu
    - move as much as possible to the debhelper install file
    - clean up kvm/bios/acpi-ssdt.aml
  * debian/patches: all patches dropped, syncing with upstream
  * debian/doc: new file, html documentation to be installed
