Send source from FrontEnd to BackEnd.


= Details =

  * Decode Successfully!


= New Plan =

  * We decide to playback in the backend instead of frontend. So we don't need to send decoded image back to frontend.
  * We need to know how to control and playback in linux.
  * We need to know window infomation in VMM so that renderer in linux can synchronized with VMM window. My Next Day plan is to research Renderer filter to know more about window infomation
