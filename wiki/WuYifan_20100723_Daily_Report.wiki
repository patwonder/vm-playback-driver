Major works done(2010-07-22 - 2010-07-23):
 * Tryed UDT(UDP-based Data Transfer), but performing even worse than direct TCP connections;
 * Configured a TAP network that merely archieves 50MB/s throughput between guest and host, but high latency when transferring short messages.

Works for next Monday:
 * Performance tuning for current TCP-based communication;
