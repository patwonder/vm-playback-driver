Major works done:
- Environment setup, installed Ubuntu(host) and Windows XP(client);
- Tried to play some video in Windows XP, vlc media player performs best with no frame drop and little more cpu cost than host while playing 1080p movies;
- Tried to enable hardware acceleration on host, but failed(missing GMA900 driver for Intel VA API).
Works for tomorrow:
- Try to enable video hardware acceleration on host OS;
- Test frame rate differences between Host+HW/Host+SW/Guest+SW.
